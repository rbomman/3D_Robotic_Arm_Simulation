# 3D_Robotic_Arm_Simulation

## 3 DOF Arm
The file forward_kinematics.py is a simple of a 3 axis robot which performs forward kinematics to map rotations given to each joint to a final position for the end effector. Use the number keys 1-6. 
<br><br>
The file inverse_kinematics.py is also a 3 axis robot which performs inverse kinematics to go from a final position for the end effector to rotational angles. Type the desired position as X,Y,Z.

## 6 DOF Arm
The file six_dof_arm.py is a simple of a 3 axis robot which also includes orientation control. By using the controller window, you can both specific forward kinematics via joint angle sliders and inverse kinematics by specifying position and orientation.
