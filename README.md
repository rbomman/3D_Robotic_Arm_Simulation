# 3D_Robotic_Arm_Simulation
There forward_kinematics.py is a simple of a 3 axis robot which performs forward kinematics to map rotations given to each joint to a final position for the end effector. 
<br><br>
The inverse_kinematics.py is also a 3 axis robot which performs inverse kinematics to go from a final position for the end effector to rotational angles.
